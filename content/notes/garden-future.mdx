description: moving to `next-mdx-relations`
draft: true
---

I initially built `garden` as a boilerplate for digital gardening. I've also worked on [`next-mdx-relations`](), which I see as a higher abstraciton that helps people quickly spin up sites with just markdown. 


### up next

- [x] content directories
- [ ] templating
- [ ] swap current config for `next-mdx-relations`
