description: dep updates and long term planning 
draft: false

I just released an incremental update for `next-mdx-relations`, which was largely a dependency upgrade (a major one). After releasing that, I've also bumped all of the dependencies for `garden`, so it should be compatible with all the latest version so React and NextJS. I've also added [dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) to help stay up to date on dependency changes to prevent these kind of large/sweeping updates in the future.

Additionally, I'm going to try to start actively working on `garden` again. If you have features you'd like to see in the near future, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

> Note that storybook is experiencing some issues with node versions greater than or equal to `17.0.0` (See [this](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/16555)). I've included a `.nvmrc` file in the repo and updated the readme to include documentation about running `nvm use`.

### up next

- [ ] templating
